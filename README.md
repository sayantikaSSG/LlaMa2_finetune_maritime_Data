# 🚢 Maritime Chatbot – Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The maritime industry relies on vast amounts of technical documentation, regulations, and operational guidelines. However, retrieving relevant information quickly remains a challenge for fleet operators, compliance officers, and crew members.  

This project aims to **fine-tune LLaMA 2** on **maritime-specific data** to develop an **in-house AI chatbot** for **Synergy**, a leading maritime company. The chatbot will assist users by providing **instant answers** to maritime queries, improving **efficiency, compliance, and decision-making**.  

## 💡 Why This Project?  
The maritime sector is governed by extensive safety regulations, complex operational protocols, and industry best practices. Searching through lengthy documents to find critical information can be time-consuming.  

A domain-specific AI chatbot can solve this problem by:  
✅ **Providing instant access** to maritime regulations and safety guidelines.  
✅ **Enhancing operational efficiency** by reducing manual searches.  
✅ **Improving compliance** by offering real-time guidance on international standards.  
✅ **Delivering Synergy-specific knowledge** tailored to company policies.  

## 🔧 Technical Approach  
We will fine-tune **LLaMA 2** on maritime datasets from **trusted sources** like:  
- **European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA)** reports  
- **United States Coast Guard (USCG)** safety bulletins  
- **International Maritime Organization (IMO)** compliance guidelines  

### **Steps Involved:**  
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Scraping and cleaning maritime reports and regulatory data.  
2️⃣ **Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2** – Using LoRA/QLoRA to efficiently adapt the model to maritime knowledge.  
3️⃣ **Evaluation & Benchmarking** – Ensuring accuracy and relevance with real-world maritime queries.  
4️⃣ **Deployment** – Making the chatbot accessible via API or web interface.  

## 🚀 Expected Impact  
- **Faster decision-making** for fleet operators and compliance officers.  
- **Accurate and reliable responses** based on real maritime data.  
- **Seamless integration** into Synergy’s workflow for **24/7 AI-assisted maritime knowledge**.
